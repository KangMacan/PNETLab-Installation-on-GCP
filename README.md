- Then Create the VM
- After the VM is created, ssh to it and switch to the root user:

Bash :
  '''sudo -i'''

3. Run the installation script for the PNETLab version 6:

Bash :
'''bash -c "$(curl -sL https://drive.labhub.eu.org/0:/upgrades_pnetlab/Focal/install_pnetlab_v6.sh)" '''


Once installation is completed reboot the VM with this command:
'''reboot'''

Wait for few seconds while the VM reboots and ssh to it again.

When the setup wizard screen appears, press ctrl + c and type the below command to switch to the root user:
'''sudo -i'''

You'll get setup wizard again. When it asks you to enter your new root password, enter it twice, give a hostname of choice, domain name of choice, and select DHCP (don't use static ip ), and leave NTP blank.

And that's it. Enjoy PNETLab!
